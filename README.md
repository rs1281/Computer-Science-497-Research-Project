Literature Review on Artificial Intelligence in Radiology - A Comparison on Breast Cancer and Covid-19 CNNâ€™s

Research Problem
This research project was aimed to enhance breast cancer detection by leveraging a combination of AI 
technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Deep 
Learning. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted, evaluating code from GitHub that focused 
on breast cancer and covid-19 detection using mammograms and X-rays.

There are two main parts to this research project. First, I conducted an extensive literature review, and second, I carried out a comparative analysis of both sets of code.
